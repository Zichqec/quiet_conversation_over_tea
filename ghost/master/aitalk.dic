	"\0\b[0]\s[3]Anyway, how have you been? \s[33]You look like you're starting to warm up, at least.\n\n \s[22]Ha, don't I know it. \s[102]The cold never used to bother me, but now I have to bundle up a lot when it gets chilly like this. \s[33]A good cup of hot cocoa definitely helps, too."
	"\0\b[0]\s[103]Drinking hot cocoa reminds me of winters years ago, where we'd all play outside for hours, then come in for a cup when we were feeling like we were frozen through. \s[23]I always tried to convince everyone that we should play in your yard, because your mom's hot cocoa was the best.\n\n \s[22]I'm serious! \s[132]She'd fill the cups halfway with marshmallows before putting any cocoa in it. How much better does it get than that when you're a kid...?"
	"\0\b[0]\s[132]I miss those days sometimes, when it snows like this. \s[131]We were so carefree back then... The world was simple and easy, and adulthood seemed so far off. \s[31]Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't take back becoming an adult for the world. But I do miss having the time and energy to play in the snow all day."
	"\0\b[0]\s[100]I've been thinking about trying to set aside some time for reading, lately. Maybe now would be the time to do it. Settled in by the fireplace with a good book and a cup of cocoa...? \s[21]Heh, it sounds nice, but I bet I'd forget about my cocoa and it'd just get cold. \s[32]That or I'd spill it on my book."
	"\0\b[0]\s[103]I guess these days, I appreciate the snow more for its beauty than its ability to create temporary structures. \s[133]I never used to realize how quiet the world gets after a thick snowfall. It's like a blanket over the earth, keeping it cozy until Spring comes again. \s[33]And the way it glitters! I never noticed how much snow glitters if you take a walk at night under the street lights. \s[23]It's really pretty."

Ick."
	"\0\b[0]\s[101]I do miss seeing them, though. Sometimes I think it's a shame they tore out the old shed and put a new one in, but I know it was for the best with how rickety that thing was. It's just... \s[33]The new one doesn't make nearly as good of icicles, you know?"

	"\0\b[0]\s[133]It looks like it's starting to slow down out there... although it's piled up a lot while we were talking. \s[33]It'll be a long drive home for me, that's for sure. \s[103]Maybe next time I should look at the weather forecast before we come out."
	"\0\b[0]\s[33]Well, we probably should be on our way. It's going to be getting dark soon, and that's the last thing we need when the roads are icy, yeah?\n\n \s[22]Right. \s[1]I'll be off, then. It was good to see you, %(username). I look forward to next time. \w8\w8\s[1000]\e:chain=end"

	"\0\b[0]\s[100]I can't believe it's been raining so hard, they said we were due for rain but not %(it)this%(itoff) much rain. \s[141]Do you think there will be flooding?\n\n \s[142]A flash flood watch, huh? I suppose we should keep an eye out, just in case. \s[31]It's a good thing I live on a hill."
	"\0\b[0]\s[140]Although, I guess we do need this rain. \s[52]Had you seen the bulletin they put out the other month about water conservation? Apparently the reservoirs were getting low. \s[152]This downpour ought to help fill them back up, if nothing else."
	"\0\b[0]\s[103]I suppose that's just how nature works, isn't it? The rain may give us a gray day, and put off our outdoor plans, and even cause some damage to our structures... \s[33]but if we didn't have rain, we'd dry up.\n\n \s[132]Yeah. I used to hate rainy days as a kid because I would be cooped up inside, but these days I don't mind them. \s[31]It gives me time to take care of some indoor projects, like cleaning up my apartment."
	"\0\b[0]\s[21]And hey, it's free watering for our gardens, too. \s[1]It's nice when nature gives us a break. \s[101]Sometimes I wonder if that's why your mom loved rainy days so much..."
	"\0\b[0]\s[103]Your mom's garden really was something special. I've tried to recreate it in my own way, \w8\s[133]but she must've just had a green thumb in a way I don't. \s[33]Mine doesn't flourish nearly as much as hers did."
	"\0\b[0]\s[101]She always had vegetables aplenty... \s[102]Every summer she'd be giving us cucumbers, tomatoes, carrots, potatoes... \s[32]Green beans, too. Those were my favorite.\n\n \s[101]Yours too, huh... Nothing beats home-grown vegetables. ... \s[31]I've never forgotten how generous she was. \s[21]Maybe that's why her garden was so bountiful."
	"\0\b[0]\s[101]That's what the rain makes me think of, these days... All the little growing things out there. Gardens, flowers, trees. \s[32]They have to get water somehow, don't they? We all need water. I suppose in a way, rain is what makes this planet go 'round."
	"\0\b[0]\s[22]Ha, am I getting too existential? \s[103]Sorry, don't mind me. I guess days like this just bring on that sort of mood. Maybe because they're usually spent indoors, alone with my thoughts."
	"\0\b[0]\s[33]Have you warmed up yet? I might need my jacket back soon, it's starting to get a bit late. \s[103]Although maybe I'll stick around a bit longer, it looks like the rain might break soon."
	"\0\b[0]\s[23]You know, I had just gotten my car washed yesterday. Go figure, huh?"
	"\0\b[0]\s[101]Well... looks like the rain is letting up a little. \s[31]We should probably get going while we can, so that you don't get soaked again on the way out. \s[1]Thanks for chatting with me. \s[20]Let's meet up again soon! \w8\w8\s[1000]\e:chain=end"

	"\0\b[0]\s[103]I really do love this time of year, the sights, the sounds... \s[33]The tastes, too. I got the pumpkin spice latte today. \s[23]Call me basic if you like, but it's so delicious I don't care."
	"\0\b[0]\s[1]Are you going to make it to the apple festival this year? \s[31]Do they have those, closer to the city?\n\n \s[131]Not so much, huh... \s[30]Well, you're welcome to come with me to ours, if you want. \s[0]That'd be fun, maybe we could invite the others too. I'm sure Ross would be happy to come along, and if we give Jay enough time to clear their schedule they can probably make it.\n\n \s[22]Yeah, I'll make sure to ask them when I get home."
	"\0\b[0]\s[30]If you don't mind, I'd like to invite Tracey, too. \s[100]I know you two haven't had as much time to get to know each other yet, but there's only one way to fix that, right? \s[3]She's only been to the festival a couple of times, I'd like to get her to come regularly with us."
	"\0\b[0]\s[2]How long has it been since you had a glass of fresh cider?\n\n \s[23]Oh, that's way too long! We'll have to send you home with a few jugs."
	"\0\b[0]\s[102]I suppose if you're coming along, we should save time for a hay ride, too... \s[21]I remember those were always your favorite. \s[31]You'd beg your mom to let you go again and again, and she'd usually let you do it at least twice. \s[21]I'll be honest, I never understood going on it more than once. You just ride in a big loop anyways."
	"\0\b[0]\s[103]My favorite was always the cider. \s[133]A glass of freshly made cider is like heaven in a cup. \s[33]The stuff you can get at the store just isn't the same. Still good, but not the same."
	"\0\b[0]\s[132]Poor Ross, he has to take more conscious care of his teeth these days, so he can't indulge in the special candy they have like he used to. \s[33]I bet he gets at least one piece of maple candy, though. There's no way he'd pass it up. \s[22]Unless, of course, they're sold out before he gets there."
	"\0\b[0]\s[1]Oh, yeah, do you still like kettle corn? \s[21]I've started bringing a couple of cups to put it in, so we can each have our own while we walk around. \s[101]It feels a little like cheating, but it works really well."
	"\0\b[0]\s[100]Yeah... I think it'll be fun. \s[20]Definitely something to look forward to. \s[31]I guess I better get plans made soon, before the leaves all come down."
	"\0\b[0]\s[133]I'm glad the apple festival is just like it always used to be, after all these years... \s[33]I mean, I'm bigger now, so the tractors don't seem as big, and the trees don't seem to go on forever anymore. But I don't mind that. \s[103]Honestly, I might prefer it as an adult. \s[23]It means I get to buy all the cider I want."
	"\0\b[0]\s[133]Hmm... \s[43]I've gotten myself all excited to go now, but it's probably still a few weeks away. \s[23]Oops."
	"\0\b[0]\s[30]Well, I suppose I should be on my way now. It's getting a bit late. \s[0]Thanks for hanging out though. \s[20]I'll be sure to text you later once I talk with the others, and we'll work out a date to get together for the festival.\n\n \s[31]Haha, alright. \s[21]Until then. \w8\w8\s[1000]\e:chain=end"
